 React folder structre 

 You can create react app by using below commond:
 
 npm init react-app filename // you can give any name i give name firstreact
When the file is created then there is 
- node_module 
- public   // there is some file related to html
- src // there is some file related to js 
- etc like gitignore , package.json and etc
 
-function which we created : they return one tag div might be there is multiple tag within this div..   
-only we write component in App.js

You can connect by two ways 

1)  * if you want to connect css with this then create separate file and give extension .css in public folder.

connect this css file by using link in index.html

2) In src file there is a file by the name of index.cs (remove every thing from that and write css code and then import in App.js file) 
by using below relative path.
